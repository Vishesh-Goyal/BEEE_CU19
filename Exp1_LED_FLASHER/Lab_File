THEORY

Concept Used:
For the task of making a LED FLASHER we have used various concepts regarding LEDS , Adrino Chips and Programming.
We used the concept regarding the N and p Junstion of a LED. The P terminal of an LED must be connected to the higher potential 
and the N terminal of the LED must be connected to the lower potential i.e grounding in this case.
We used the concept of how a breadboard is designed and the slots individually are internally connected.
We used the concept of how the wires are connected in a breadboard and concept regarding different Analog and Digital ports.
We used the concept of using while loops in the program while setting up the adrino.
